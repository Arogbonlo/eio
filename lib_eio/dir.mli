(** A [_ Dir.t] represents a particular directory in some filesystem.
    It is a pair of a base directory and a path relative to that location.

    {!Eio.Stdenv.cwd} provides access to the current working directory.
    For example:

    {[
      let ( / ) = Eio.Dir.( / )

      let run dir =
        Eio.Dir.save ~create:(`Exclusive 0o600)
          (dir / "output.txt") "the data"

      let () =
        Eio_main.run @@ fun env ->
        run (Eio.Stdenv.cwd env)
    ]}

    It is normally not permitted to access anything above the base directory,
    even by following a symlink.
    The exception is {!Stdenv.fs}, which provides access to the whole file-system:

    {[
      Eio.Dir.load (fs / "/etc/passwd")
    ]}
